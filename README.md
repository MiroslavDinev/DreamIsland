# DreamIsland

**Dream Island** is for ASP.NET Core MVC course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni"). The server is built on ASP.NET CORE 5.0 and it is using SQL Server for storing the data. The application consists of roles (user, partner and administrator) and offers (islands, cars, celebrities and collectibles). Each user can register, login and logout. During registration a confirmation email with activation link will be sent to the email address provided. Users can also search for the offer they are looking for, view each offer details and book it via contact form sending email to administrator. Partners can add offers (needs to be approved by administrator to become publically visible), edit and delete their own offers. Admins can edit, approve and delete offers.
